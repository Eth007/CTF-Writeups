# Chaplin's PR Nightmare 5 - 50 pts, 203 solves
>Charlie also has an imgur account that may hold the secret to his PR nightmare... Can you find it?

>The inner content of this flag begins with **"tH"**

Note: Reading all [previous writeups](https://github.com/Eth007/CTF-Writeups/tree/master/UIUCTF%202021) for this OSINT series will help make this writeup less confusing. :)

We are tasked with the challenge to find Charlie's Imgur account and find the flag on it.

Imgur is a site used to share images and gif's. Charlie has posted a lot of pictures and gif's on his social media's. What if these images could lead us to his Imgur account?

The images on his twitter lead to nothing, but on his [website](https://www.charliechaplin.dev/home), in the "About Us" tab, we find a picture that is connected to a link

Sure enough, it leads us to a picture posted by Charlie's Imgur account, `[  
ChaplinDevelopment](https://imgur.com/user/ChaplinDevelopment). 

If we go to his user page, and look at his comments, we can find the flag.

Flag: `uiuctf{tH3_pR_p0Lic3_h@vE_cAugHt_Up?!}`

Thanks to Thomas for all the great OSINT challenges! ♥️
